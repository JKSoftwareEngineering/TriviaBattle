    <h1>Project 2</h1>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>Since Project 3 is essentially a javascript game I wanted to begin experimenting early with a interactive program.  Since one of the options was trivia, I decided to build a trivia game.  The process of building this page was relatively straight forward.  I am familiar with JSON files which is the method of data being sent to this site by the <a href="https://opentdb.com/">open trivia database</a>. Knowing how to process the data I decided to be a little more ambitious than a search engine.  First, I followed the pretty straight forward approach of pulling data from an api through XML to get any question.  Then I set up modifications to the url that gets the JSON through the search bar and question difficulty.  Next, I set up the health of the player and the enemy as well as the player skill difficulty which governs the impact of missing a question.  Finally, I added images to make it a more visually interesting when you get a question right or wrong</p>
    <h2>Tutorials  Used</h2>
    <p>In building this project I used information from the Web Apps series.  For pulling data from an aip I referred  to the gif finder.  Additionally the only part of this site that I sought outside help from was from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_autocomplete.asp">W3Schools</a>.</p>
    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p>The Questions and answers all come from <a href="https://opentdb.com/">opentdb.com</a>.</p>
    <p>The font comes from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/My+Soul">fonts.google.com</a>.</p>
    <p>The Images are my own and the original copies  can be presented upon request.</p>
